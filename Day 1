What is cloud and history: 
Before the past 20 years there is no cloud platforms, so whenever we required to deploy the application, we have to buy the servers physically from different regions of the world and have to configure its network and deploy the application in to those servers. After deploying suppose we require only 1gb of ram for maintaining, we don't have an option to buy only 1gb ram servers. We have to buy 100gb of ram servers. From this the major drawback is there is lot of waste of ram usage and more cost to maintenance servers physically and it is difficult overall to maintain physical servers. So, to encounter this problem AWS come forward and introduced its cloud services by giving only required amount of servers to the users and paying for only whatever they have used. 

Public vs Private cloud :
Private cloud is simply buying servers physically and deploying our applications without the help of any cloud providers. 
On the other hand Public cloud is the cloud where we can buy servers from the cloud providers.

Why Public cloud is better than private?
1. Less cost compare to private cloud.
2. Public cloud cuts down the major headache to their users such as maintaining servers and checking connections and giving network configurations as everything will be taken by cloud providers only. 

Why AWS is better than others?
1. AWS is the first cloud provider in the industry, it has first come advantage.
2. AWS have the majority of the market share and also they have more services. So, many companies are preferring AWS over other cloud providers.
